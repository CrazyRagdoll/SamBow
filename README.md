Personal Project

Hey, I've decided to start to create my own personal project, not too sure what it's going to be in the end
but it's for a little bit of fun and to keep up to date with C++ programming.

Included Libraries:

GLEW - Version 2.0.0:
http://glew.sourceforge.net/

SDL2.0:
https://www.libsdl.org/download-2.0.php

GLM:
http://glm.g-truc.net/0.9.8/index.html
